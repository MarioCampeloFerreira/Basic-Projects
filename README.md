 <h1 align="center">About me</h1>
 
Hey there! I'm diving into programming and learning Python because I've always been intrigued by it. Turns out, it's not only really enjoyable but also potentially beneficial for my field in Business Management. Mastering coding might even open doors to a developer job someday! I'm loving the journey, having fun, and feeling accomplished when my code (even if simple). If you're curious about my progress, check out my project repositories, where I share basic projects that help me improve my skills. Got some exciting ideas for future projects too! Can't wait to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts, learn together, and immerse ourselves in this fantastic community! ðŸ˜„



<h3 align="center">ðŸ’¡ Future ideas ðŸ’¡</h3>

a few ideas ranging from very easy to hard difficulty 


**Multiple Choice Quizz**

A multiple Choice Quizz that will show a random german noun and the user has to choose one of the 3 options (Der, Die, Das) and must display the correct option afther giving the answer

ideas: 

A highrecord feature

**Easy: Unit converter**

A unit converter allows users to convert values between different units of measurement, such as temperature, length, or weight.

Tips:

Create functions for each type of conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, kilometers to miles).
Use input and conditions to let users choose the conversion type and enter the value to be converted.
Why do this project:

You'll learn about functions, user input, and performing calculations with user-supplied values.
The project helps you understand how to create a practical utility that users can interact with.
What you'll learn:

Variables, input/output, functions, and conditions.

**Easy: To-Do List app**

A simple To-Do List app allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

Tips:

Use a list to store tasks.
Create functions to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
Implement a loop to keep the app running until the user decides to exit.
Why do this project:

You'll learn about lists, loops, and functions in Python.
The project helps you create a practical application that can manage tasks.
What you'll learn:

Variables, input/output, loops, functions, and list manipulation.
Easy: Simple text-based RPG

**A basic text-based RPG** 

allows players to explore a small world, interact with characters, and complete simple quests.

Tips:

Design a small world with a few locations, characters, and quests.
Use dictionaries and lists to store information about locations, characters, and quests.
Implement a loop to keep the game running, allowing players to navigate through the world and interact with characters.
Why do this project:

You'll learn about dictionaries, lists, loops, and basic game design principles.
The project helps you create a simple interactive game that engages players in a story.
What you'll learn:

Variables, input/output, loops, dictionaries, lists, and basic game design.

**Intermediate: Simple chatbot**
Creating a simple chatbot can help you learn about user input processing, string manipulation, and decision-making using conditions. The chatbot will respond to user queries based on predefined rules and patterns.

Tips:

Define a list of possible user inputs and corresponding chatbot responses.
Use string manipulation and conditions to match user input to predefined patterns.
Implement a loop to keep the conversation going until the user decides to end it.
Why do this project:

It will help you understand natural language processing at a basic level.
You'll learn how to create a more complex interaction with the user.
What you'll learn:

Variables, input/output, loops, conditions, string manipulation, and decision-making.
Advanced: Web scraping

**Web scraping**

is the process of extracting information from websites. Implementing a web scraper in Python will teach you about HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and data extraction.

Tips:

Choose a simple website or API for your first web scraping project.
Use libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to make HTTP requests and parse HTML content.
Make sure to follow the website's terms of service and robots.txt rules to avoid any legal issues.
Why do this project:

You'll learn about HTTP requests and HTML parsing, which are essential skills for working with web data.
The project will help you understand how to access and process data from websites and APIs.
